#BIRDSi

BIRDSi is an IoT device that enables law enforcement officers to easily control drones in order to patrol common routes and search large crowds for people. 

There is a mobile application that is used to commandeer the device - the drone itself. From the mobile app, users can fly the drone, set a pre-determined route for the drone to loop around as well as enter persons of interest into a database of people for the drone to look for as it's flown or loops around. 

This app was built for the CS160 class on UI/UX Design at UC Berkeley in the Spring of 2014. It was made in Kinoma Studio and is a prototype - not a finished real-world application.

This repo contains the device side prototype of BIRDSi; it represents the drone that is being controlled. The mobile application aspect can be found in the *birdsi* repo.
